<h1>GitOps - Deploy to Kubernetes using Jenkins Github Pipeline</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of an application running in Kubernetes then a code change is pushed to GitHub. As soon as the changes are committed, a Jenkins job get submitted automatically, builds a new image and then pushes the new image to DockerHub. The deployment file for the application will be changed with the newest image ID and the new image will be automatically deployed to the Kubernetes cluster, which causes our application to point at the new pod.
